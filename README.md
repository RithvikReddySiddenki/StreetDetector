# StreetDetector
StreetDetector is a Next.js web application with a Python FastAPI backend for real-time YOLO object detection. The frontend, deployed on Vercel, provides an interactive interface for uploading images, while the backend runs the TensorFlow model to detect objects and returns structured results for display in the browser.
